## Contributing to Libra Core

To contribute to Libra Core, ensure that you have the latest version of the codebase. To setup Libra Core with all the necessary dependencies for linting, testing, and building the documentation, run the following:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/libra/libra.git
$ cd libra
$ ./scripts/dev_setup.sh
$ source ~/.cargo/env
$ cargo xbuild
$ cargo xtest
```

## Coding Guidelines

For detailed guidance on how to contribute to the Libra Core codebase refer to [Coding Guidelines](coding-guidelines.md).

## Documentation

All developer documentation is published on the Libra developer site. The developer site is open source, and the code for building the site is located in this [repository](https://github.com/libra/website/). The developer site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Pull Requests

During the initial phase of development, we plan to only audit and review the pull requests. As the codebase stabilizes, we will be able to accept pull requests from the community.

To submit your pull request:

1. Fork the `libra` repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you have added code that should be tested, add unit tests.
3. If you have made changes to APIs, update the relevant documentation, and build and test the developer site.
4. Verify and ensure that the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code passes both linters.
6. Complete the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), if you haven't already done so.
7. Submit your pull request.

## Code of Conduct
Please refer to the [Code of Conduct](../policies/code-of-conduct.md), which describes the expectations for interactions within the community.
